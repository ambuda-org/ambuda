Ambuda Documentation
====================

This is the technical documentation for Ambuda, a breakthrough Sanskrit library
hosted at https://ambuda.org. We wrote this guide for anyone who wants to run
Ambuda locally or contribute to Ambuda's technical work.

This doc is owned by our community, and it is a constant work in progress. We
strive to keep it current, but even so, parts of it might be out of date.

If you have any questions or comments about the material here, please reach out
to us on our `Discord`_ server so that we can improve our documentation.
