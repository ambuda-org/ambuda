Ambuda Documentation

This is the technical documentation for Ambuda, a breakthrough Sanskrit library
hosted at https://ambuda.org. We wrote this guide for anyone who wants to run
Ambuda locally or contribute to Ambuda's technical work.

This doc is owned by our community, and it is a constant work in progress. If
you have any questions or comments about the material here, please ask us on
our `Discord`_ server.
