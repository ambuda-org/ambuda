Quickstart
==========

All of Ambuda's major commands are in `Makefile`.


Running the development server
------------------------------

After you've cloned the repo, you can bring up a minimal setup by running the
following::

    make install
    make db_seed_basic
    make devserver

Then go to `localhost:5000` to see the local application.

Some parts of Ambuda, such as PDF parsing, need to run tasks in the background.
To add support for these in your local setup, run the following::

    ./scripts/install_osx_dependencies.sh
    make celery

If you also plan to make CSS changes, run the following command in a
separate terminal window::

    make tailwind_watcher

Roughly, Tailwind generates a new CSS file whenever it detects certain changes
to Ambuda's HTML files. For more details, see the Tailwind docs.


Linting and testing
-------------------

For linting, you can use::

    # Lints both JS and Python.
    # To lint just Python, run `black .`
    # To lint just JS, run `make eslint`.
    make lint

To run unit tests, you can simply run::

    make test

And to check test coverage, run::

    make coverage


Database migrations
-------------------

Database migrations are complex. If you're pulling an upstream change that
contains a database schema change, run this command to upgrade your local
database::

    alembic upgrade head

See :doc:`managing-the-database` to learn more about how to work with the test
database and safely make schema changes.


Documentation
-------------

Finally, you can generate these docs with::

    make docs

Then you can view the output by opening `_build/index.html`.
