Values and principles
=====================


Values
------

Ambuda's mission is to make the Sanskrit tradition universal accessible.
*Universal access* is Ambuda's core value, and it affects not only the project
as a whole but also how we design and nurture our code and community.

From a community perspective, universal access means that we communicate openly
and visibly about our project. For us specifically, it means that we send out
regular project updates on our mailing list, track technical work on GitHub,
and have more open discussion on Discord. Everyone is welcome to join in on our
ongoing discussion.

From a code perspective, universal access means that we build in public so that
everyone can see how our project is doing and participate in it themselves. It
means that we bias toward obvious and boring technology that anyone can read
and understand. And it means that we take care to write code that is clear and
simple.

From a data perspective, universal access means that we rely on open and public
data and produce open and public data in return. Although licensing rights
often prevent it, we strive to release our texts under a `CC0`_ (public domain)
license.


Principles
----------

Ambuda's tech stack follows a few basic principles:

1. Our readers care about our content and features, *not* our technical stack.
   All of our technical work should be connected to a clear user problem. We
   must not build features just because they're interesting technically.

2. The hidden enemy of any tech project is complexity. Unless there is a *very*
   good reason to embrace it, we should keep complexity low in all parts of our
   project.

3. Our core team is an ever-changing group of volunteers with various
   backgrounds and skills. When in doubt, we should prefer simple, well-known,
   and well-documented technologies that have been repeatedly tested in
   production systems.
