Ambuda is building a complete archive of traditional Sanskrit literature. This
is a massive undertaking on an urgent timeline: Sanskrit manuscripts don't last
forever, and there is no guarantee that the future will be as peaceful as it is
now.
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
We need to build the capacity and the capital for such an effort before it
is too late. <strong>We can do so only with your help.</strong>
{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}
Here is how you can help Ambuda grow:

If you're short on time, using Ambuda and sharing it with others is the
easiest way to help our project.

Ambuda's technical work is massive and unending, and it touches basically
every part of the stack: frontend, backend, infra, storage, databases,
security, OCR &amp; NLP, UX and user research, and many more.

<p>Basic work includes:

<ul>
  <li>Solving small and narrowly scoped technical problems.</li>
  <li>Flagging rough edges in our code and documentation.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Solving larger but still well-defined technical problems.</li>
  <li>Communicating with technical team members on design decisions.</li>
  <li>Improving our code health and documentation.</li>

  <li>Solving large and ambiguous technical problems.</li>
  <li>Communicating with non-technical team members on design decisions.</li>
  <li>Owning and maintaining pieces of the project on an ongoing basis.</li>

{{ _h('other') }}

There are dozens of other important problems that we need to solve for
Ambuda to grow properly: community management, fundraising, outreach and
