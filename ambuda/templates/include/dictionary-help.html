<p>{% trans %}Notes on specific dictionaries:{% endtrans %}</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The Apte dictionary uses special conventions so that its entries
      take up less space on a printed page (e.g. {{ 'paMktiH'|d }} and {{
      'vanaM'|d }} instead of {{ 'paGkti'|d }} and {{ 'vana'|d }}). Our
      dictionary optionally supports these conventions: you are free to
      follow or ignore them as you wish.</p>

  <li><p>The {{ 'zabdakalpadrumaH'|d }} generally expects that nominals
      are given in their {{ 'prathamA-ekavacanam'|d }} form instead of their
      {{ 'prAtipadika'|d }} form ({{ 'naraH'|d }} and {{ 'rAjA'| d }} instead
      of {{ 'nara'|d }} and {{ 'rAjan'|d }}) and that roots are stated in
      their Paninian form ({{ 'cara'|d }} and {{ 'Saha'|d }} instead of {{
      'car'|d }} and {{ 'sah'|d }}).</p></li>

  <li><p>The {{ 'vAcaspatyam'|d }} generally expects that roots are stated in
      their Paninian form ({{ 'cara'|d }} and {{ 'Saha'|d }} instead of {{
      'car'|d }} and {{ 'sah'|d }}).</p></li>
